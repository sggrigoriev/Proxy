VERSION 1.2.2 02-JUL-2018
=================================================================================================
1. Folder proxy_eui64 moved to lib
2. Logging has two additional debug levels: LL_TRACE_2 and LL_TRACE_1
3. New settings on ProxyJSON.conf
3.1.  "DEVICE_ID":			"IPCam-9876080027F78CD0" -- It makes possible to set the specific DeviceID w/o its generation
3.2.  "CURLOPT_CAINFO":               "" -- path to Certificate Authority (CA) bundle
3.3.  "CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER":       1  -- verify the peer's SSL certificate.

VERSION 1.2.1 11-JUN-2017
=================================================================================================
1. EM-102 fixed.
   The GW analysing all incoming messages for status value and makes reconnect in case of "UNAUTHORIZED" and "UNKNOWN" values
2. EM-116 fixed. New define variable PROXY_ETHERNET_INTERFACE added to all branches of CMakeLists file.
   The interface used has to be set to this varaible to inform the cloud about local IP Address.
   The information is sent from GW to the Cloud every time after the reconnect procedure.
   If the interface defined is nod found during the run-time or not defined at all the Proxy will log
   the warning and will not send the ipAddress to the Cloud.
3. The MAIN CLOUD URL value is kept in separate file.
   New setting appeared in proxyJSON.conf file: "MAIN_CLOUD_URL_FILE_NAME": "./cloud_url".
   The file pointed has to contain just one string with mail cloud url value.
4. The name of the file with the FW upgrade now is configured in wud.conf file.
   New setting "FW_UPGRADE_FILE_NAME":         "presto_mt7688.tgz" appeared.
5. All informal diagnostics logged by Proxy and WUD were changed for bored, sorry, professional variants.
6. EM-134 done. "SET_SSL_FOR_URL_REQUEST" setting added to the ProxyJSON.conf.
   If the setting has value 0 the contact URL request from the nain cloud URL does not contain the "ssl=true" parameter.
   If the setting value is 1 or the value is absent the "ssl=true" exists in the request. Made for debugging purposes.
   The setting should not be presented in business configuration!
7. EM-135 fixed.
8. EM-136 done. Log record now has the following format: YY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.MMM <thread ID> <log level> <message>.
   The thread ID was added for filtering purposes

1. Bug fix: 102, 105, 106, 107, 112
2. Changes in the files list: Proxy/proxy_threads/pt_change_cloud_notification.* were removed. Please change corresponding makefile!
3. CMakeLists.txt changes: proxy_http/*.c added to the test_client process
4. The gateway starts work with the Agent independently on internet connection.
5. The first request to the main URL has the ssl=true parameter, so the default main URL could starts from http or https w/o difference
6. The gateway could be reauthorized during its work now.
7. Some typos fixed in log records

3. Bug fix: FW UPGRADE, remote file reading - incorrect connection reopening fixed
4. Bug fix: http erase connection - conn value check for negative value added
5. For all messges sent to the cloud the incremental numeration added. NB! WUD and Proxy have independent numbers!
6. Agent messages are switching right to the SERVER_WRITE thread w/o forwarding it to the PROXY_MAIN thread

VERSION 1.1.6 01-APR-2017
=================================================================================================
1. Define PROXY_DEVICE_ID_PREFIX="aioxGW-" added for Proxy (C)make file to be able change the gatewayID prefix w/o code change
2. "Reboot" notification added:
    {"measures": [{"deviceId": "<deviceID>","params": [{"name": "reboot", "value": "<N>"}]}]}
   - V = 1 if the gateway is going to be rebooted by any reason (including the command from the cloud)
   - V = 2 on gateway's startup - i.e. after the reboot
3. Notification for main URL change by the gateway:
    {"measures": [{"deviceId": "<deviceID>", "params": [{"name": "cloud", "value": "<new cloud URL>"}]}]}
    The order is:
    - Gateway get new main URL
    - Gateway get new contact URL & new auth token
    - Gateway switches on new contact URL
    - Gateway sends the notification by old contact URL in he case of succesful switch to new URL.
4. Two new files appears in Proxy/proxy_threads directory:
    pt_change_cloud_notification.h
    pt_change_cloud_notification.c

1. c98 standard compatibility
2. Now it is possible to build using make
    2.1 export HOST=mips-linux
    2.2 make  -f Makefile.make
    2.3 resulting files is in
3. AUTH_TOKEN file loosing prevented by sync() call after auth_token write
4. Dealay on reconnect added in case if internet connection lost - LIB_HTTP_DEFAULT_CONN_REESTABLISHMENT_DELAY_SEC added into lib_http.h. Set on 1 second
5. Log file(s) cleaned if it is reached the max amount of records and start from the beginning. (pu_logeer changed)
6. Long messages control fixed. Agent's message longer than 7993 rejected


VERSION 1.1.4 08-MAR-2017
=================================================================================================
1. Directory name for firmware upgrade adjusted with the firmware script (/root/download
2. WUD startup delay decreased to 30 seconds
3. activation token from version 1.1.3 is stored in separate file auth_token.

VERSION 1.1.3 06-MAR-2017
=================================================================================================
1. Added compatibility with OpenWRT build system
   - change dir to the OpenWRT root
   - cd package
   - mkdir presto-private-sdk
   - git clone https://github.com/eemoss/presto-privatesdk-c -p <RELEASE-BRANCH>
   - cd presto-privatesdk-c
   - cp Makefile.openwrt ../Makefile
    After that return to the openwrt root, run make menuconfig, then go to the 'Network' menu and select (*) presto-proxy
2. Bug with maximum message length is fixed. The max incoming message for the Agent is 7992 bytes
3. Auth token is separated from ProxyJSON.conf. It saved in a separate file. It's default name is "auth_token" and the path is the same as for ProxyJSON.conf
4. ProxyJSON.conf is changed:
    - "ACTIVATION_TOKEN" setting removed
    - "AUTH_TOKEN_FILE_NAME" setting added. The value should be the full path and file name to the file with auth token
5. Firmware file move from download to upgrade directory implemented as copy and rename to avoid problems with different partitions
6. Cloud "reboot" command is implemented: to receive such a command WUD is making reboot
    Command example:{"status": "ACK", "commands": [{"type": 0, "commandId": 42126, "deviceId": "GATEWAY_ID", "parameters": [
    {"name": "reboot", "value": "1"}]}]}
7. Uptime value is used for all timeouts to avoid system time jumps.

VERSION 1.1.2 28-FEB-2017
=================================================================================================
1. CMake version downgraded to the 2.8.0

VERSION 1.1.1 24-FEB-2017
=================================================================================================
1. The Proxy startup sequence:
 1.1 Start Agent
 1.2 Start WUD

2. The firmware version
 Installation script must create the file "firmware_release" containing only one text string with firmware version.
 file firmware_release must be stored in /root/presto

3. wud.conf has new setting "WUD_DELAY_BEFORE_START_SEC"
 This declares the time in second WUD start delay. This made to wait until the gateway synchronized own timer with the network time

4. Firmware upgrade functionality enabled
 4.1 wud.cong file should contain two settings:
        "FW_DOWNLOAD_FOLDER" - full path with the directory WUD will use to download and check file
        "FW_UPGRADE_FOLDER"  - fill path with the directory WUD place the firmware file renamed to "presto_mt7688.tgz"
 4.2 After the presto_mt7688.tgz will appear in upgrade folder WUD will make the reboot to allow the AIOX script make installation process

5. Watchdog functionality enabled; automatic processes start (currently for Proxy only!) enabled
    5.1 wud.conf should contain following settings:
          "AGENT_PROCESS_NAME"           - the agent name ("Agent" usually)
          "AGENT_BINARY_NAME"            - full path to the agent's executable with file name
          "AGENT_RUN_PARAMETERS"         - agent start parameters list
          "AGENT_WORKING_DIRECTORY"      - agent's working directory
          "AGENT_WD_TIMEOUT_SEC"         - Agent's timeout in seconds.NB! After this time WUD will reboot the gateway if the Agent will not send any watchdog message!!
          "PROXY_PROCESS_NAME"           - same for Proxy. NB! Proxy is already started by WUD
          "PROXY_BINARY_NAME"
          "PROXY_RUN_PARAMETERS"
          "PROXY_WORKING_DIRECTORY"
          "PROXY_WD_TIMEOUT_SEC"
          "WUD_COMM_PORT"                - WUD will receive watchdogs from the Agent & Proxy by this port as a server

    5.1 proxy.conf should contain following settings:
          "PROXY_PROCESS_NAME"   - the value of this setting shoulb be equal to the "PROXY_PROCESS_NAME" in wud configuration file
          "WATCHDOG_TO_SEC"      - time period in seconds for watchdog messages sending to the WUD. NB! thr period should be less than "PROXY_WD_TIMEOUT_SEC" and to less than 30 seconds
          "WUD_PORT"             - the value shoud be equal to "WUD_COMM_PORT" in wud.conf file

6. WUD reboot functionality enabled
    6.1 WUD rebooting the GW at the end of firmware upgrade process before the installation starts
    6.2 WUD rebooting the GW if watchdog timeout for Agent and/or Proxy watchdog messages exceeded
7. /root/startApplication.sh must run only WUD. WUD must be started after presto-zb
8. After start, WUD delays for WUD_DELAY_BEFORE_START_SEC seconds. Currently it is set to 120 seconds.
    This is MUST until Aiox will not fix time coorection problem
9. Directory layout
    /root/presto
        root/presto/WUD
            WUD
            wud.conf
        root/presto/Proxy
            Proxy
            proxyJSON.conf
     /root/download
     /root/upgrade

10. Log files for WUD and Proxy is created in corresponding directories. This files has limited size, configured by application files (5000 lines now)
11. Build
    export PLATFORM=cross
    export OPENWRT_PATH=/home/yctung/mt7688/openwrt
    export GCC_STANDARD=c90
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
12. Upgrade procedure
    Download folder is /root/download
    upgrade folder is /root/upgrade
    Know limitation: download and upgrade folders should reside on same file system (mount point)




    Resulting files including proper configs can be found in presto-private-sdk/build/cross

Known bugs
